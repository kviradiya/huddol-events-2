issue tracking
=====

* every issue should have a `priority-???` tag
* every issue should be a `task`, `bug`, or `question`
* `bugs` should be one of `visual` or `functional` or both
* `tasks` should include one of `frontend` or `backend` or both, possibly `infrastructure`
* `questions` are free form
* problems with translation should be marked as `i18n`

coding standards
=====

* Use real tabs for indentation instead of spaces (follows [Wordpress PHP Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/))
